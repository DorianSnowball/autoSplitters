# Load Removers for `Horizon Forbidden West™`™

The latest load removers (.vas files) can be downloaded on the [Release Page here](https://github.com/blegas78/autoSplitters/releases) (No HFW since it doesn't exist)

#### Just as a preperation for adding HFW load removers to the collection :)



###### Don't kill Aloy pls


## Testing

I *HIGHLY* Recommend testing this before attempting a run each day by doing a quick test.
With all of the above up and running and showing IGT, try to start the timer and invoke a load by simply performing a fast-travel or loading a save.
